_How to play_

BABs Memory Game is a simple game of matching based on memory of where a card's match was last seen.  

Simply click on a card to start the timer and start looking for pairs.  Once all cards are paired up the game is over.  A window will open up showing you how long it took you, how many moves and your star rating.  

Your star rating is based on the number of moves needed to complete the game.
